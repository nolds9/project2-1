I should really use Trello for this, but I'm more familiar with typing stuff out
in a text editor than using cards.

CRUD complete for Tournaments, Teams. Devise for Users complete.
* Need to create association between Users - Teams, Tournaments - Registration (JOIN tables) - Teams.

Areas that need work:
* Styling (0 styling currently)
* GOOD seed data
