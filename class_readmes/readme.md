# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project #2: Building Your First Full-stack Application

### Overview

This project is your first foray into **building a full-stack application from the ground up.**

**You will be working individually for this project**, and you'll be designing the app yourself. You may work from home, except for mandatory one-on-ones with your pod instructor.

We hope you'll exercise creativity on this project, sketch some wireframes before you start, and write user stories to define what your users will want to do with the app. Make sure you have time to run these ideas by your instructors to get their feedback before you dive too deep into code!

**This is exciting!** It's a lot to take on, but we've given you the tools over the past few weeks to be able build what you need, and you get to decide what you do with it. And you get to be creative in choosing what sort of application you want to build!

Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals&mdash;**scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!**

### Technical Requirements

Your app must...

* ...be build in **Rails**.
* ...**have at least 2 models** with **at least 1 association** (more if it makes sense). One model should represent someone using your application.
* ...**include sign up, log in, and log out functionality**, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow.
* ...**have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
* ...**utilize an ORM to create a database table structure** and interact with your relationally-stored data.
* ...have **semantically-clean HTML and CSS that passes the standard validators**. (See "Resources" below)
* ...**be deployed online** and accessible to the public.

---

### Deliverables

* A **working full-stack application, built by you**, that meets the technical requirements above.
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with **frequent commits dating back to the very beginning** of the project.
* A **link to your hosted, working application** in the URL section of your Github repo.
![The URL section of your Github repo](http://i.imgur.com/QQ7RsfR.gif)
* **A ``readme.md`` file** in the root of your repo, with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
* **A `planning` directory** in the root of your repo, containing...
  * A `wireframes` directory, inside of which are *at least* 2 photos or drawings of wireframes
  * A `user_stories.md` file, containing at least 7 user stories, *or* a link to Trello with at least 7 user stories.

### Tips

* **Begin with the end in mind.** Spend a dedicated block of time to planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't need.
* **Don't hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems**. When we say "throwaway", we mean **commit**, **then** throw it away. **[Never, ever, ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA4iX5D9Z64&ab_channel=TaylorSwiftVEVO) delete code working code such that it can't be retrieved.**
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** The docs often include a tutorial that can help you get started, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don't be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Deploy early, deploy often.** Addressing any deployment bugs early and incrementally will prevent last-minute scrambling.
* **User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application**. It's tempting to just use them as _todo lists_, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about being able to do, it will help you prioritize your features and tasks.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps streamline your process.

### Potential Project Ideas

##### Cheerups
The world can be a depressing place. Your task is to create an app that will allow people to create and share "cheerups" - happy little quips to brighten other peoples' days. Cheerups will be small - limited to 141 characters. Members will be able to promote Cheerups that they like and maybe even boost the reputation of the Cheerupper.

##### Bookmarket
You will create an application where users can bookmark links they want to keep. But what if users could trade bookmarks for other bookmarks? Or sell bookmarks for points? Or send bookmarks to your friends. Or something even crazier.

##### Photo Sha.re
Users will be able to register and create albums and photos. Albums and photos will need to be named and described by their owners. Users will be able to view other users' albums. Maybe users can comment on photos, or either up/down vote them. (Please note: file uploading can be tricky and memory-intensive. We encourage you to review the screencasts of [last week's mini-lesson on file uploads with Carrier Wave & AWS](https://github.com/ga-dc/curriculum/tree/master/mini-lessons/file-uploads-with-carrier-wave-and-aws) or use a separate image uploading service like Imgur or Flickr and only store the *URLs* of those images in your app itself.)

##### Something Else You Think Would Be Rad!

You're not limited to the above ideas, feel free to come up with your own idea. Just make sure to run it by your instructor to make sure the idea is feasible within the time constraints of this project week.
