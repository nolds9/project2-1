You will have three one on ones. Your squad instructor will slack you to schedule all of them:

## Monday (15 minutes)
- Review planning documents for feasibility and completeness
- Delineate the scope of "MVP" for the student's project
- Set goals for Monday and Tuesday
- Identify first steps toward achieving Monday's goals
- Identify potential pitfalls and challenges for the week ahead

## Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday (30 minutes)
- It's up to you!
